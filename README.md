WIP
 
This repository will have code and slides for my upcoming ScalaX talk: neural network from scratch in scala

key components/concepts:

- fs2 for concurrent
- "supervised learning"
- load visualise your data http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
    - scala is pretty bad at this
    - load them as stream?
- forward propagation
- backward propagation
- cost function
- cross validation; training error, testing error
- optimizations
    - initialization
- latest technologies/algorithms
    - evolution of error rates
    - convnet


- scalafmt

- scala/jvm's image library is embarrasing; eg. no pyplot.imshow(numpy array) equivalent
